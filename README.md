NoSpamBot - SMS Spam Detection
NoSpamBot is a machine learning-based SMS spam detection tool designed to identify and filter spam messages from legitimate ones. This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms to help users block unwanted and harmful spam messages.

Overview
Spam messages are a common nuisance, often leading to data theft, fraud, or unwanted distractions. NoSpamBot addresses this problem by offering an intelligent solution that detects and classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The project uses machine learning models to automatically identify the likelihood of a message being spam based on its content.

This project can be used in mobile applications, messaging platforms, or integrated into SMS gateways to filter spam messages before they reach the user.

Features
Accurate Spam Detection: Leverages machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages into spam and non-spam categories.
Real-time Filtering: Automatically filters incoming messages in real-time.
Easy Integration: Simple API to integrate into messaging applications.
Dataset: Uses a publicly available SMS spam dataset for training the model.
Performance Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip (Python package installer)
Steps to install:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/NoSpamBot.git
cd NoSpamBot
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and prepare the dataset (if necessary, see dataset section below).

Run the project:

You can start by running the model training script or load the pre-trained model for prediction:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Or, to predict spam messages using the trained model:

bash
Copy code
python predict_sms.py
Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use the following methods for spam detection:

1. Training the Model:
Train the model with your dataset of SMS messages. The dataset must contain labeled examples of spam and ham messages.

Run the following command to train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will save a trained machine learning model to the models/ directory.

2. Making Predictions:
After training, you can use the model to classify new SMS messages as spam or ham. The script predict_sms.py takes in a message and predicts whether it is spam.

Example usage:

bash
Copy code
python predict_sms.py "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card!"
The output will be something like:

vbnet
Copy code
Message: "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card!"
Prediction: Spam
